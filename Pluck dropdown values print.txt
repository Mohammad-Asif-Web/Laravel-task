 in the Controller, we have code which uses pluck() directly in the Eloquent query:
$roles = Role::pluck('name', 'id');

And then in the Blade, we would show all the roles as options of a dropdown select:

<select name="role_id">
    @foreach($roles as $id => $role)
        <option value="{{ $id }}">{{ $role }}</option>
    @enforeach
</select>
